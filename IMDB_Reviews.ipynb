       "\"I had a heck of a good time viewing this picture, and was splendidly surprised at its more erudite features. First off, the film is undeniably cheaply-made with its cardboard sets, limited settings, and creative scientific props. The acting ranges from very poor(the two strippers), barely professional(Herb Evers as the leading man), gothic overstatement(Leslie Daniels as the assistant Kurt)to first-rate with Virginia Leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancee's lustful passions. The scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this ilk. Issues abound about what role science and medicine have in our lives and what their boundaries should be. This film is a thinking film in many ways. However, don't be too fooled by its real intent. It is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with his aptitude in medical science who wishes to fuse together his dead girlfriend's head with the perfect body, thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul. One other very bright aspect of the film is the sax music which resonates strongly every time the doctor scours town for female beauties.\""

       "'My wife and I both thought this film a watered-down, made-for-TV (BBC) version of Manhattan Murder Mystery...which is itself good, but not great. The story has little inter- character tension or chemistry, and not much of a plot. Woody Allen\\'s character just sort of wanders around running off at the mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson don\\'t have a lot more to do. It\\'s pretty disappointing, I must say. Ian McShane\\'s role is just an expanded cameo appearance. The first thing that occurred to me was \"I wonder how much the BBC had to pay Woody Allen to dislodge him from Manhatttan?\" He must\\'ve needed the money, and they must have needed his appeal to expand their audience beyond the youth market drawn to the two stars. I\\'m giving this movie 4 stars instead of 3 because it is unbothersome background noise. If you ever want something to have on while you\\'re knitting or sorting your stamp collection, this\\'ll do the job. I wouldn\\'t pay to rent it again.'"
